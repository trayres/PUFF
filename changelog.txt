2000-11-12: first public release of the patch files for Linux.

2001-02-18: second release, fixing a few problems:
   - keyboards with a non-US layout now work correctly.
   - the question mark (for component sweeps) can now be entered
   - export of artwork as an HPGL file now works.
   - PUFF's built-in printer support now works.
   - one cause of an FPU stack overflow, causing a "runtime error 207",
     has been found and fixed.
   (thanks to Stefan Frank, DG1BAZ, for pointing out most of these
   problems and help with fixing and testing)

2006-01-31: third release:
   - update for compatibility with more recent versions of the Free 
     Pascal compiler (e.g. version 1.9.4).
     Using such a recent version of the compiler is needed for
     compatibility with Linux 2.6 kernels.
   (Thanks to Lorenzo Rosa, IK4XQM, for providing the modified Makefile.
   The update of the package was in January 2006, but Lorenzo's updated
   Makefile had been available separately on my webpage since 2004.)

2006-02-17: fourth release:
   - update for compatibility with Free Pascal compiler version 2.0.0 .
     This version is no longer compatible with earlier compiler versions;
     if you have any of those, you should use an earlier version of the
     package.
   - minor bugfix in pfrw_21.pas; this bug showed up with version 2.0.2
     of the compiler, but not with 2.0.0 and earlier, so I'm not sure
     whether the bug is in the puff code or in the compiler... (it's a
     buffer overflow happening during a ReadLn() call).

2007-02-11: fifth release:
   - minor update for compatibility with version 2.0.4 of fpc.
   (Thanks to J.W. Bruce for testing this.)

2010-01-17, pa3fwm: 
  make insert_key default to true, and remember this setting when changing
  window (to match what users nowadays expect on a computer).

2010-01-17, pa3fwm: 
  removed references to CGA from the code (mostly in outdated comments, since
  the code didn't seem to support CGA anymore anyway).

2010-01-20, pa3fwm: 
  don't hide the filename extension (.puf) on the screen.

2010-01-18...22, pa3fwm: 
  made the screen (i.e., the X11 window on linux) resizable.
  (Since the code was written with a few fixed screen sizes in mind, this
  was non-trivial; there are still a few situations where a resize is not
  handled perfectly, e.g. between the first and second Esc keypress for
  leaving the program.)

2010-01-22, pa3fwm: 
  - removed the _21 from the source file names.
  - updated the initial screen.

2010-01-25, pa3fwm: 
  - removed/corrected some more outdated comments and DOS code
  - added Alt-s to help window

2010-01-27, pa3fwm: 
  - fixed window resize in case plot data is not valid
  - added README.txt
